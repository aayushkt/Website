                        <h1>About Me</h1>
                        <p> Hi! My name is Aayush Singh, and I'm a recent graduate from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I completed my BS in Computer Science, along with a minor in Mathematics and Data Science. I love to code and am constantly working on a project or two during my free time. I'm especially good working with backend systems and servers, developing cool new algorithms, and doing over-complicated math.</p>
                        <p> I'm also a huge fan of games! From card games, to board games, and video games too - I love learning, losing, strategizing, and improving! I build games in my free time, and solve them too! Working on complex algorithms to optimally select the 'best move' for a game is one of my favorite problems.</p>

                        <p class="cardSubHeading"> Jan - May 2022 [8 Months] </p>
                        <p> I interned at 3DFS Technologies, a startup specializing in using software to correct electricity currents on the scale of nanoseconds. I used embedded programming techniques in C to write software that operates at these lightning fast speeds, meaning algorithm design and optimization were key. I implemented signal processing algorithms and security failsafes, and programmed directly into microprocessor memory for maximum performance. </p>
                        <p> Alongside product development, I also implemented and designed SQL databases to manage company inventory. I created an HTML, browser-based front-end application for users to log into the databases and perform operations, which were forwarded to a custom python back-end I built for SQL optimization.</p>

                        <p>Started developing a blockchain based video game, which evolved into a LLC gaming studio called 'Moira Labs' with the help of two other Co-founders. Moira Labs was hand selected for Private Venture Group's exclusive startup accelerator program, and is now developing in stealth. More to come soon!</p>
                        <p>At Moira Labs, I have designed, managed, and developed key elements of comany software. Being Project lead for one project involved merging pull requests, planning future features and systems, and working closely with a team of developers. I have also specialized in handling the cloud services used by the company, including configuring and launching multiple Amazon Web Services containers, such as S3 data buckets, SQL database instances, Cognito authorization pools, and more. </p>

                        <p>I would always play the classic finger game 'Chopsticks' (somtimes also called 'Sticks') as a kid, and so I decided to try solving it. It was a surprisingly difficult process! As far as I can see, no one has ever worked on this problem, so first I had to develop the algorithms and logic required for a perfect Chopsticks player. I independently proved, solved, and then implemented theorems from linear algebra and graph traversal algorithms to make an AI that wins every game without fail.

                        <p>I have a passion for all things math, and teaching is no exception. During my freshman year at UNC, I was able to work as an Undergraduate Learning Assistant with the UNC Math Department. I helped professors teach MATH 231 (Calculus of Functions) and MATH 110L (Algebra), to over 200+ students. I would talk to students during and after class to assess strengths and weaknesses, and create material to help students learn. I would record videos of practice problem solutions, and host group study sessions with students to work on problems together. I'm happy to say that I helped many students not only understand, but gain a newfound respect and passion for math. </p>

                        <p> I was individually asked by two of my professors to join them under UNC's directed reading program, in order to conduct research into advanced math topics. We ended up researching formal logic systems and Godel's Incompleteness Theorem over the course of the semester. The research concluded with a presentation to the UNC Math Department on our findings. </p>

Formed a team with one other undergraduate student, and used math modeling and data science techniques to analyze a given data set.

                        <p> During the time I spent studying network protocols, I also implemented my own version of the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP for short). SMTP is one of the oldest protocols out there, with an RFC (the official document specifying the protocol) that dates back to 1982, the early days of the internet. Back then, passwords and files would often be sent plaintext, unencryped, over the internet - there was nothing stopping someone from simply checking other people's email (kind of like actual mail)! To get a better understanding of implementing official RFC protocols, and of mail servers in general, I decided to implement my own version of SMTP, compliant with all the protocol standards outlined in the official RFC document in python.</p>
